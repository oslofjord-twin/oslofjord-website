          Our aim is to develop a digital twin to model and analyze climate pressure on ecosystems in the Oslo Fjord. A digital twin is a modelling framework that integrates real-time sensor data.

        We collaborate with <a href=https://friskoslofjord.no >Frisk Oslofjord </a>, a project which collects data from the fjord. Frisk Oslofjord provides real-time and historical data about salinity, temperature, oxygen, plankton, etc. in the Oslo Fjord.  The topic of this thesis is to develop a semantic digital twin for the Oslo Fjord.

        This digital twin will be used in the context of ongoing digital twin activities at UiO and the <a href= https://uio.no/dscience> dScience center </a> . The digital twin will ultimately enable semantic analysis and, building on that, data visualization by oceanographers and other interested members of the public.
      </p>
      <p class="lead text-center">
        The digital twin architecture will be developed using <a href= https://smolang.org> SMOL </a>,a language developed at UiO specifically for digital twins. SMOL integrates simulators of physical systems with semantic web technologies and databases.  The thesis encompasses working with SMOL, time series databases, and visualization frameworks.  Since the decision of which visualization framework and database to use is part of the thesis, we welcome students with experience in these areas, but this is not a necessary prerequisite.
