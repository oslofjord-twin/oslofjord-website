### Summary
<p>
Our long-term vision is to develop technologies to better understand
the effect of climatic stressors on ecosystems. The project combines
cutting-edge technologies to enable the analysis of extreme weather
events, an increasingly common phenomenon due to climate change. We
integrate advanced mathematical models, digital twin technology and
custom sensors to support experiments to predict the effects of
extreme weather in near real-time. The project addresses fundamental
methodological challenges for digital twin technology for natural
systems: (1) models as interpolation between sensor observations and
(2) multiscale model composition.</p>

### Project Synopsis
Climate associated changes such as elevated sea surface temperature,
shifts in circulation and stratification, altered nutrient input and
oxygen content, and increased ocean acidification have all been
identified as environmental variables that could impact species
distributions, phenology, and demography which again could impact the
functioning and services of the overall ecosystem.  A key to better
understand natural areas that are exposed to climate change, lies in
the connection between ecosystems and technology. Several parameters
affect the physical conditions in a fjord system, e.g.,
circulation. There is potential to improve methodology for data
collection and modeling to gain more information about the physical
conditions in such systems.

This interdisciplinary project investigates fundamental challenges for
the use of digital twins to monitor fjord systems when extreme weather
events occur on land and sea. These events happen increasingly often,
and will be important as input for circulation models with frequent
changes at the interface between rivers and ocean.  In a complex
system such as a fjord, it is impossible to get measurements with
sufficient resolution in time and space to cover all the areas of
interest in great detail. Linking high-spatial resolution numerical
(e.g., hydrodynamic) models with operational ocean models allows for
simulations of dynamics in the ocean and investigate the dominating
processes that change, e.g., circulation.

<p>We develop a digital twin for our study area, the Oslo Fjord, which
can show the effect of extreme weather events in near real time as
well as perform "what-if" experiments to predict the effects of
changes in the physical system. In contrast to so-called earth system
models, which combine different physical models at a global level, our
focus will be local, which allows our models to be directly coupled to
local, empirical observations.  During intense precipitation periods
(extreme weather), the circulation in the fjord system will
change. The interface (river inflow) between the models changes
dynamically during these periods. A high- resolution computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) model will be developed to account for these
changes. The output of the CFD simulations together with sensor data
will be used as input to the operational model, with the digital twin
as an interface.  The project concretely studies two fundamental
methodological challenges for digital twin technology used to monitor
climate change of natural areas:</p>

+ **Models as interpolation between observations:** How to use models to
couple time series data from different locations in a physical system
and validate the quality of such interpolations experimentally?

+ **Dynamic scope in digital twins:**
How to dynamically change precision in digital twins locally for a
critical area in the physical system by coupling multiscale models
with empirical observations on demand?

The project is highly interdisciplinary and brings together three
disciplines: oceanography, hydrodynamics (fluid mechanics) and digital
twins.

### Positioning wrt the UN Sustainability Goals

<p>The project contributes to Goal 9 through research and technology
development that improves the business sector’s technological ability
and capacity to handle sustainability both in the inner Oslo fjord and
more generally, by developing solutions for new technology for climate
monitoring. Through the use case, the project contributes to Goal 11
by providing methods for managing the environmental impact of cities
and improving Oslo residents’ access to safe outdoor areas in the
fjord through our specific focus on conditions in the Oslo fjord. Of
course, the project is also relevant to Goal 14 by developing
technology to understand the effects of climate change, reduce marine
pollution and contribute to sustainable marine ecosystems. Our main
impact towards addressing the sustainability goals will be in
demonstrating the potential of digital twins to understand the effects
of climatic stressors on marine systems, as an instrument to monitor
these climatic stressors in near real time, and to explore thresholds
in the ecosystem for the effect of climatic stressors through
“what-if” experiments using digital twin technology.
